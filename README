========

A simple graphical frontend to Delwink's [PATTS][1] using the PyQt module for
Python 3.

Required Modules
----------------

The following modules must be installed for Python 3 for this application to
run.

| Module | Purpose                                |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| PyQt4  | GUI Toolkit                            |
| patts  | PATTS-specific features and operations |

On Debian, PyQt4 can be installed with

described in their documentation.
